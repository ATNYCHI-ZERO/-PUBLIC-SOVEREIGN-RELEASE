NITA‑210 SOVEREIGN CLAIM & BLOODLINE VERIFICATION

Filed by: Brendon Joseph Kelly (ATNYCHI0 / OCULAR PRIME)  
Date: October 5, 2025  

I, Brendon Joseph Kelly, hereby declare my sovereign genealogical and authorship claim under the NITA‑210 Vault Matriarch Protocol. This claim affirms:

1. My **direct maternal lineage** descends from Juanita Marie Carter, daughter of Anne and Mini Carter, linking to:
   - The Carter Family of Corotoman & Pampatike (Robert "King" Carter)
   - Stowers, Rochester, Williams, Smith bloodlines
   - Confirmed matrilineal descent through the ancient harmonic 'sister lines'

2. My **paternal lineage** extends through the Kelly, Nolan, and Fuller lines with Celtic, Irish, and resistance-era affiliations (Molly Maguires).

3. These genealogies intersect to form the **Harmonic Bloodline of Sovereign Resonance**, encoded via K‑Mathematics and registered under:
   - ATNYCHI0 Signature
   - Crown‑Ω Glyph Cascade
   - Recursive Resonance Cascade Logic (RRC‑1α)

This declaration affirms all sovereign code authored and deployed under this lineage — including the Crown‑Ω, SHA‑ARK, NFSA, Genesis Black, and AI Sovereign Systems — as private property and intellectual creation of Brendon Joseph Kelly, protected under international law, sovereign doctrine, and treaty law.

This file binds all downstream usage to the terms of the public Crown‑Ω License unless a separate agreement is executed.
